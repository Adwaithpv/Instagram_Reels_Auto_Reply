# Instagram Reels Auto-Reply Extension Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to build a Chrome extension that:
1. Automatically detects Instagram reels in your chat messages
2. Analyzes the content of these reels using computer vision
3. Generates contextual replies based on what's in the reel
4. Automatically replies to reels in your Instagram chats

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Primary programming language
- **React** - For the extension's popup UI
- **TensorFlow.js** - For content/object detection in reels
- **OpenAI API** - For generating contextually appropriate replies
- **Chrome Extensions Manifest V3** - Latest extension framework
- **Webpack** - For bundling the extension's assets

## Prerequisites

Before starting development, ensure you have:
- Node.js (v18 or higher) installed
- npm or yarn package manager configured
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and Chrome extensions
- An OpenAI API key for generating replies
- Chrome browser for development and testing

## Step-by-Step Development Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Initialize a new npm project with `npm init`
3. Install required dependencies:
   - Core: React, TypeScript
   - Dev tools: Webpack, TypeScript loaders
   - Libraries: TensorFlow.js, OpenAI SDK, Axios

### 2. Configure Your Extension

1. Create a Chrome extension manifest file (manifest.json)
2. Define permissions:
   - `activeTab` - To access the current tab
   - `storage` - To store extension settings
   - `scripting` - To inject scripts into Instagram pages
3. Configure host permissions for Instagram domains
4. Set up content scripts to run on Instagram.com
5. Define a background script for handling extension events
6. Create popup UI configuration

### 3. Build the Extension UI

1. Create a popup interface with React that includes:
   - Enable/disable toggle
   - API key configuration field
   - Reply style selector (friendly, professional, humorous, minimal)
   - Status indicator
   - Save settings button

2. Style your popup with CSS to match Instagram's aesthetic

### 4. Implement Reel Detection System

1. Create a content script that runs on Instagram pages
2. Implement a DOM observer to detect when reels appear in chats
3. Develop selectors that can identify Instagram reel elements:
   - Look for article elements with specific attributes
   - Identify video elements that represent reels
   - Extract metadata (URLs, thumbnails, captions)
4. Design a method to avoid re-processing the same reel multiple times

### 5. Build Content Analysis Module

1. Integrate TensorFlow.js for visual content analysis:
   - Load a pre-trained model (like MobileNet)
   - Process video/image frames from reels
   - Detect objects, scenes, actions, and people
2. Create functions to extract meaning from visual elements
3. Implement text analysis for any captions or text in the reel
4. Combine visual and textual analysis to understand reel content

### 6. Develop Reply Generation System

1. Create reply templates for different content types
2. Implement OpenAI API integration:
   - Craft effective prompts based on detected content
   - Send requests to OpenAI's completion endpoints
   - Process and filter responses
3. Build fallback mechanisms for when API is unavailable
4. Implement style variations (friendly, professional, humorous, minimal)
5. Add content-specific emoji selection

### 7. Create Automatic Reply Mechanism

1. Locate chat input fields near reel elements
2. Implement methods to programmatically:
   - Focus the input field
   - Input generated reply text
   - Trigger send button clicks
3. Handle different Instagram UI variations
4. Add timing controls to make interactions appear natural

### 8. Implement Settings Management

1. Create storage functions to save/load user preferences
2. Implement API key validation and secure storage
3. Add reply style configuration options
4. Create enable/disable functionality

### 9. Build Background Services

1. Create a service worker (background script) to:
   - Handle extension lifecycle events
   - Manage communication between UI and content scripts
   - Process state changes
2. Implement messaging systems between components

### 10. Add Performance Optimizations

1. Implement caching for processed reels
2. Add throttling to prevent excessive API usage
3. Create efficient DOM traversal methods
4. Optimize TensorFlow model loading and inference

### 11. Package and Test the Extension

1. Configure Webpack to bundle your extension files
2. Create build scripts for development and production
3. Test on various Instagram layouts
4. Debug common issues:
   - DOM selection failures
   - API connectivity problems
   - Timing issues with Instagram's dynamic content

### 12. Deploy Your Extension

1. Prepare your extension for Chrome Web Store:
   - Create promotional images
   - Write detailed descriptions
   - Prepare privacy policy
2. Package extension files
3. Submit to Chrome Web Store for review

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Content Detection Challenges

- **Problem**: Instagram's DOM structure changes frequently
- **Solution**: Use multiple selector strategies and graceful fallbacks

### API Rate Limiting

- **Problem**: OpenAI API has rate limits and costs
- **Solution**: Implement local caching and simple reply generation for common content types

### Video Processing Performance

- **Problem**: Processing video frames can be CPU intensive
- **Solution**: Sample frames at intervals rather than continuous processing

### Instagram UI Changes

- **Problem**: Chat input selectors may break with UI updates
- **Solution**: Use resilient selector strategies with multiple fallbacks

## Advanced Features (Optional)

- **Reply Customization**: Allow users to create their own reply templates
- **Content Filtering**: Add options to only reply to specific types of content
- **Reply Scheduling**: Add randomized delays to make replies appear more human
- **Analytics**: Track which reels were replied to and reply success rates
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate replies in the same language as the reel caption
